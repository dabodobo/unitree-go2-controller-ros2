Hi ! I'm David Román, student from Universitat Jaume I and member of RobInLab researching group.

This project was motivated by the desire to test movement using a controller and the ROS2 interface incorporated into Unitree robots.
For now, the robot moves smoothly using the joysticks on the controller. In addition, this project can be scaled up to send different movement commands remotely.
